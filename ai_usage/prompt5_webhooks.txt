Prompt:
Give me a simple approach for webhook management: storing multiple webhooks (URL, event type, enabled), testing them, and sending test requests asynchronously.

AI Output:
- Create table: id, url, event, enabled, last_test_status, last_test_time
- API endpoints: create, update, delete, list, test
- Test webhook asynchronously via Celery (HTTP POST)
- Store test response code + duration
- UI only needs simple forms for add/edit/delete
- No retry logic required for assignment
