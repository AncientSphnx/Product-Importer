Prompt:
I need a minimal HTML + JS page for uploading a CSV and showing progress. No frameworks required. Show a file picker, upload button, and progress bar that polls the backend.

AI Output:
- Use plain HTML input type='file', button and progress
- On upload, send file using FormData
- Backend returns task_id
- Use setInterval() to call /progress/<task_id> every 1s
- Update progress value and show percentage text
- On completion, display "Import completed!"
