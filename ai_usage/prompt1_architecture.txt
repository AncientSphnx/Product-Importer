Prompt:
Help me design the architecture for a Python-based product importer app that can handle a CSV with 500,000 rows. I need file upload, async processing with Celery, progress tracking, and CRUD UI. Recommend the best folder structure, database schema, and how to track progress.

AI Output:
- Use FastAPI or Flask for backend
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM + PostgreSQL
- Use Redis as Celery backend for fast progress updates
- Store upload file temporarily and pass file path to Celery worker
- Use chunked CSV reading (10,000 rows at a time) to avoid memory spikes
- Track progress using Redis keys import:<task_id>:processed and import:<task_id>:total
- CRUD operations can be simple REST endpoints
- Webhooks stored in separate table
- Suggested folder structure:
/app
  /api
  /models
  /workers
  /services
  /static
  main.py
